●Introduction

   Thank you for downloading "DGCA".
   "DGCA" is designed with an emphasis on the balance between high compression ratio and expansion speed, ensuring the safety of archives.
   This is a file compression program that has been pursued to the extreme.
   In addition to general-purpose compression functions, it also creates customizable self-extracting files.
   It can also be used to create simple installers.


●File structure

   After unpacking you will get the following files: Please check your configuration.

         dgca.exe (program itself)
         dgcac.exe (console application for Windows advanced users)
         dgca.txt (the text file you are currently reading)
         history.txt (update history)
         Extension (extension DLL folder)
         Language (folder for language files)
         Sample (sample data folder)
         Theme (screen customization folder)


●Operating environment

   Compatible with OS MS Windows95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP (Japanese version).
           (For overseas versions of Windows, it may not work on anything other than 2000/XP)
   Memory RAM 128MB or more recommended. (Lower than this may slow down)
           (When HyperThreading is turned on, 256MB or more of RAM is recommended (planned))
           Approximately 32MB is sufficient when expanding (64MB when using HyperThreading)


●Execution method

   Run dgca.exe.
   When you run it for the first time, please configure the options first. command pro
   If you are running a console application from a prompt, run dgcac.exe.

   ・F5 Update list
   ・BS Move to the next higher folder
   ・Enter Opens the file in the associated application
                      If it is a compressed file, you will be able to view the internal file list.
                      You can expand only the selected ones.
   ・Left double click Same as Enter
   ・Left click select

●Explanation of setting items and terms

   【command】
   ·compression
     Compress one or more files or folders into a single compressed file.

   ・Development
     Extract files and folders from compressed files and restore them.

   ·Split
     Split large files into specified sizes.

   ・Join
     Combine the split files and put them back together.

   ・Verification
     Checks whether the contents of a compressed file and a specific file or folder are the same.

   ·inspection
     Check the compressed file for any abnormalities.

   ·protection
     Adds information that can be used to repair the compressed file if it becomes slightly corrupted.
     Therefore, the size will be slightly larger.

   ·repair
     Attempts to repair protected compressed files if they become corrupted. too much damage
     cannot be repaired.

   [Compression mode]
   ・No compression
     Archive files without compressing them. It's very fast. JPG or MP3
     Since this data has already been compressed, select uncompressed when combining them.
     It would be a good idea to choose.

   ・File concatenation compression (SOLID mode)
     This is the normal mode that compresses files and stores them in the archive.

   [Output file format]
   ・DGC format
     It's a normal compressed file. Use DGCA when expanding (unzipping).

   ・Self-expanding format
     This is a format that allows you to extract the archive just by running the file. It increased by about 100Kbyte.
     However, it is useful when giving a DGCA to someone who does not have it.

   [Compression options]
   ・Add repair information
     After compression, we protect it.

   ・Verification check after compression
     After compression, the collation command is automatically executed and the original files are restored when the archive is expanded.
     Check to see if it exactly matches the file.

   ・Prioritize sameness
     Folder timestamps etc. are not written to the archive.
     Even if you unzip and recompress, the archives will be completely consistent at the binary level.
     vinegar. This is a function for file sharing software that wants to match the hash values of archives.

   ・Specification of uncompressed file extension
     Files with the specified extension will not be compressed during the compression process. already compressed
     processing will be faster. Also, archives are uncompressed for fast access.
     Also specify this when there is a file you want to store.

   [Self-deployment option details settings]
   ・Hide window
     Specify this when you do not want to display the Window during expansion.

   ・Display file set name
     Specify if you want to name the set of compressed files.
     When you name it, the terminology changes from "deployment" to "installation."

   ・Specify the installation destination
     Specify this if you want to specify the default extraction location.

   - Specify the file to open after extraction
     After unpacking (installation), the specified file will be added to the associated application.
     Click to open. Used to display README, etc.

   - Specify the executable file and command to be launched after extraction
     Use this when you want to start an executable file after unpacking (installation).
